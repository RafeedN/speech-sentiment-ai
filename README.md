# Speech-to-Text Sentiment Analysis AI  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is a simple **AI-powered application** that converts **speech into text** and performs **sentiment analysis** on the spoken words.  
It uses:  
- **SpeechRecognition + Google API** for speech-to-text  
- **TextBlob** for natural language sentiment analysis  

The AI classifies the spoken input as **Positive 😊**, **Negative 😠**, or **Neutral 😐**.

## 🎯 Learning Goals  
- Understand how to build an end-to-end **AI pipeline** from raw input (speech) → processed data (text) → analysis (sentiment).  
- Learn to work with **Python libraries for AI and NLP**.  

---

## 📚 What I Learned  
- How to capture microphone input in Python using `speech_recognition`.  
- How to preprocess and analyze text sentiment with `TextBlob`.    

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python 🐍  
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) – speech-to-text  
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) – microphone input  
- [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) – sentiment analysis

---

## ✅ Achievements  
- Built a functional **speech-to-text + sentiment analysis AI** 🎉  
- Automated analysis of spoken language into **positive, neutral, or negative** tone.  

---

✨ Future improvements could include:  
- Using **transformers (Hugging Face)** for more advanced sentiment analysis.  
- Building a GUI or web app so non-technical users can try it.  
- Logging all transcripts and sentiments into a database or file.
